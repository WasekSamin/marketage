                <span class="fw-bold">Payment Services Provider(s)</span> are service providers that provide payment services to Buyers and Sellers in connection with the Marketage platform, including with respect to collection of funds from Buyers in connection with purchases, remittance and withdrawal of funds to Sellers, currency exchange services in connection with payments and withdrawals in local currencies, and the holding of funds in connection with Marketage Balances.

<li class="payment____text text-muted">If an order is canceled (for any reason), the funds paid will be returned to the Buyer’s Marketage Balance. </li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Sellers are responsible for paying any direct or indirect taxes, including any GST, VAT or income tax, which may apply to them depending on residency, location or otherwise, under provisions of their jurisdiction. Sellers represent and warrant that they comply, and will comply at all times, with their obligations under income tax provisions in their jurisdiction. The price shown on the Offer page or on the Logo Maker order page is inclusive of all such taxes and charges that may apply to the Sellers.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Appointment as Limited Payment Collection Agent: Seller hereby appoints Marketage as Seller’s limited authorized payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting payments (via its Payment Services Provider, if applicable) from Buyer, and remitting those payments to Seller.  Seller agrees that payment from Buyer to Marketage shall be considered the same as a  made directly to Seller. Buyer’s payment obligation to Seller will be satisfied upon receipt of payment by Marketage (or its Payment Services Provider, as applicable), and Marketage (via its Payment Services Provider, as applicable) is responsible for remitting the funds to the Seller in the manner described in these Payment Terms. In the event that Marketage (via Payment Services Provider) does not remit any such amounts to Seller, the Seller will have recourse only against Marketage and not the Buyer directly. Seller agrees that Marketage may describe or otherwise reflect the terms contained herein in any terms of service, receipts, disclosures, or notices including, but not limited to, receipts provided to Buyers that Marketage may deem necessary or prudent.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Marketage partners with Payment Services Providers for purposes of collecting payments from Buyers, transferring such payments from Buyers to Sellers, and holding funds in connection with Marketage Balances. All payments services in connection with the withdrawal of funds on the Marketage platform are performed by Marketage’s Payment Services Providers.</li>

                                  <ul>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">To withdraw your revenue, you must have an account with at least one of Marketage 's Payment Service Providers for the withdrawal methods listed below. All funds eligible for Withdrawal will be held on your behalf at an account with Marketage’s Payment Services Provider.  All payment services, including withdrawal services, will be provided by Marketage’s Payment Services Provider.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Your Marketage profile can be associated with only one account from each Marketage withdrawal method. A Payment Service Provider withdrawal account can be associated with only one Marketage profile.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Revenues are only made available for withdrawal from the Revenue page following a safety clearance period of 14 days after the order is marked as complete. Top Rated Sellers are eligible to withdraw revenue following a safety clearance period of 7 days after the order is marked as complete. For Marketage Studio Members, the safety clearance period depends on the Studio Lead’s Level Status or classification (Level 1, Top Rated, Pro, etc.).</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Sellers may withdraw their revenues using one of  Marketage’s withdrawal options (see Withdrawal Section below regarding payment terms). To withdraw your available revenue, you must click on the designated withdrawal provider to initiate the withdrawal process.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">For security concerns, Marketage may temporarily disable a Seller’s ability to withdraw revenue to prevent fraudulent or illicit activity. This may come as a result of security issues, improper behavior reported by other users, or associating multiple Marketage accounts to a single withdrawal provider.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Withdrawals can only be made in the amount available to you.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Withdrawal fees vary depending on the withdrawal method.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Withdrawals are final and cannot be undone. We will not be able to reverse this process once it has begun.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">In certain cases, Sellers may withdraw Revenues in several different currencies. All currency exchange services in connection with such withdrawals are performed by Marketage’s Payment Services Providers. Your Marketage Balance is always derived from its US$ value and, therefore, the local currency amount of your Marketage Balance may change daily in accordance with exchange rate fluctuations and also includes conversion fees. Sellers always have the option to withdraw Revenues in US$.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Sellers will be able to withdraw their revenues from disabled accounts after a safety period of 90 days following full verification of ownership of the account in question, from the day of the last cleared payment received in their account and subject to Marketage's approval.</li>

All payments services in connection with the collection of funds on the Marketage platform are performed by Marketage’s Payment Services Providers.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Marketage serves as Seller’s limited authorized payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting payments (via its Payment Services Provider, if applicable) from Buyer, and remitting those payments to Seller.

In the event that Marketage (via Payment Services Provider) does not remit any such amounts to Seller, the Seller will have recourse only against Marketage and not the Buyer directly.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">In most locations, purchases on Marketage can be made by using one of the following payment methods: Credit Card, PayPal, Marketage Credits or existing Marketage Balance. Additional payment methods may apply in certain locations. More information on available payment methods is available <a href="#">here</a></li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Service fees are added at the time of purchase where you can review and accept the total amount requested to pay. These fees cover administrative fees. As of March 2021, the service fees are 5.5% of the purchase amount. For purchases under $50 an additional $2 small order fee will be applied.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Your existing Marketage Balance will be automatically applied to your next purchase.</li>

<li class="payment____text text-muted">You agree to receive invoices and/or payment receipts from Marketage in electronic form as PDF documents, by email or through the Site.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">To protect against fraud, unauthorized transactions (such as money laundering), claims, or other liabilities, payment information in connection with withdrawals is collected by either Marketage or Marketage’s Payment Services Providers. Payment Services Providers may also collect such other information as necessary for the purpose of processing withdrawal payments.  Marketage is not exposed to the payment information provided to Payment Services Providers, and this information is subject to the privacy policy applicable to the Payment Service Provider. Please see our Privacy Policy for more information here.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">By using any payment method and/or providing payment details for making purchases on Marketage, you represent and warrant that: (a) you are legally authorized to provide such information; (b) you are legally authorized or have permission to make payments using the payment method(s); (c) if you are an employee or agent of a company or person that owns the payment method, you are authorized by that company or person to use the payment method to make payments on Marketage; and (d) such actions do not violate any applicable law.</li>

                             <ul>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">All Logo Designs have a fixed US$ price and can be purchased either in the “Basic Logo Package” or in additional packages as indicated in the Logo Design order page. </li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Before completing an order, you will be able to preview a watermarked version of the Logo Design embedded with your brand name, and to further modify the Logo Design using the editing tools. Once payment has been made, orders of Logo Designs may not be canceled.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">In addition to the Logo Design package you choose, you can purchase redesign services from the Seller who created the Logo Design. The price of such redesign services is determined by the Seller and a service fee will be charged solely for the additional redesign services. For cancellations of logo redesign services, please refer to the “Disputes and Cancellations” section below.</li>

<li class="payment____text text-muted">You can pay on Marketage in several different currencies. Unless stated otherwise, you will be charged in the currency displayed on the payment page. All currency exchange services in connection with payments in local currencies are performed by Marketage’s Payment Services Providers. In certain cases, however, when certain currencies are not supported by certain payment methods, you will be charged in US$ even if the price is displayed in another currency. In any event, the actual charged amount (in the actual payment currency) will be clearly disclosed to you before you complete the payment.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Note that all prices on Marketage are derived always from their original US$ price and, therefore, non-US$ currency prices may change daily in accordance with exchange rate fluctuations and may also include conversion fees. Buyers always have the option to pay in US$ by changing their selected displayed currency.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">If you paid for an Order in a currency other than US$ and your Order was later canceled for any reason, the amount returned to your Marketage Balance would be based on the exchange rate as of the date of cancellation. Therefore, the returned amount may vary from the paid amount in local currency terms, while always maintaining the same US$ value.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Your Marketage Balance is always valued in US$, even if it is displayed in a non-US$ currency. Therefore, should you choose to view your Marketage Balance in any currency other than US$, it may change daily in accordance with exchange rate fluctuations, while always maintaining the same US$ value. Users always have the option to view their Marketage Balance in US$ by changing their selected displayed currency.</li>

                             In certain instances, Marketage may offer you credits (“<span class="fw-bold">Marketage Credits</span>” or “<span class="fw-bold">Credits</span>”), either for promotional purposes or otherwise, to be used for purchasing Offer's and/or other services offered on the Site. Your available Credit balance will appear in your account. Your valid Marketage Credits will be automatically applied to your next purchase and can be viewed in your order summary after you place the order. Unless stated otherwise, Marketage Credits expire following three months from their receipt. Marketage Credits serve only as an incentive to use Marketage, and, therefore, are not redeemable for cash, have no cash value and are nonrefundable. Once used, Marketage Credits may not be returned to your account even if your Order gets canceled. Marketage Credits may be subject to additional conditions and restrictions as will be disclosed to you upon receipt of the Credits. Credits may be voided in the event of fraud, misuse, or violation of these Terms. Marketage reserves the right to modify or cancel the Marketage Credits program at any time. If you or Marketage deactivate or suspend your Marketage account, any unused Marketage Credits in your account will be forfeited.

<li class="payment____text text-muted">Marketage Customer Support will cancel orders based on, but not limited to, the following reasons:</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Active orders (after requirements were submitted to the Seller and before the Seller delivers on Marketage):</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">The Seller is late and unresponsive for more than 24 hours while the order is marked as Late.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Users are abusive towards the other party through threats of low ratings or leveraging order materials (such as logins, personal information) against each other.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Users supplied or included copyright/trademark infringing materials as part of their requirements or the Seller’s delivery.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">The user is no longer an active Marketage user due to Terms of Service violations or closure of their account.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Delivered Orders (after the Seller clicks Deliver Now and before the order is marked as complete)</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">The Seller uses the Delivery system to extend the delivery due date to complete the requested service without providing the final delivered service. Note: Multiple reported offenses will result in permanent suspension of your account.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">The Seller delivers no files and/or proof of work related to the agreed upon order requirements. Note: Subjectivity of the materials in question will be reviewed by our Customer Support team.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">The Seller requests additional payments, on or off the Marketage platform, by withholding the final delivery of services directly related to the agreed requirements.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">The Seller is withholding the final delivery of services for improved ratings.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Users who abuse the Request Revisions button to gain more services from Sellers beyond the agreed requirements.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Users who threaten to leave a damaging review to gain more services from the Seller not related to the agreed requirements.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Completed Orders (after the order is marked as complete and before the 14-day limitation)</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Users who have been reported to use copyright/trademark infringing materials after verification and with proof.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Users who did not purchase commercial use rights and are reported to have used the materials commercially. Note: Terms of Commercial use are found on the Seller’s Offer Page and cannot be retroactively included once the order is completed for over 14 days.</li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Marketage Customer Support will review cases of Order delivery manipulation that prevents users from fully utilizing our Resolution Center that enabled the order to be marked as complete.</li>

                          <p class="payment____text text-muted">Marketage reviews cases of payment provider chargebacks and disputes on behalf of Sellers. Although results vary per case due to each chargeback reason, we work hard on resolving disputes in the Seller’s favor. If the chargeback case allows, Marketage (or one of Marketage’s Payment Services Providers) will return parts or full revenue back to Sellers, otherwise the chargeback amount will be borne by the Seller. </p><br>

                              <ul>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Marketage does not automatically refund payments made for canceled orders back to your payment provider. Funds from order cancellations are returned to the Buyer's Marketage Balance and are available for future purchases on Marketage. Until January 1, 2019, funds returned to your Marketage Balance from canceled orders will not include service fees paid. As of January 1, 2019, Marketage returns service fees to your Marketage Balance once an order is canceled. In any event, if the service fees were not returned to your Marketage Balance following an order cancelation, such service fees’ amount will be exempted from your next purchase on Marketage. </li>
<li class="payment____text text-muted">Deposit refunds (i.e. refunds directly to your payment provider) can be performed by our Customer Support team, based on the Order’s original payment amount and currency. To prevent fraud and abuse, we limit the total amount of times users can request a payment provider refund, which is subject to review by our Customer Support team. Such refunds may be subject to an additional fee.</li>
