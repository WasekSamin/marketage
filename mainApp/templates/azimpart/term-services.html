               <span class="fw-bold">Basics</span>

               <li class="text-muted text_____align">Sellers create Offers on Marketage to allow Buyers to purchase their services.</li><br>
               <li class="text-muted text_____align">Sellers may also offer Custom Offers to Buyers in addition to their Offers.</li><br>
               <li class="text-muted text_____align">Each Offer you sell and successfully complete, accredits your account with a revenue equal to 80% of the purchase amount.</li><br>
               <li class="text-muted text_____align">Marketage accredits Sellers once an order is completed. See our "<a href="{% url 'manage-order' %}">Orders</a>" section below for a definition of a completed order.</li><br>
               <li class="text-muted text_____align">For more information about receiving payments, fees and taxes see the <a href="{% url 'payment-term' %}">Payment Terms</a>.</li><br>
               <li class="text-muted text_____align">Sellers may not promote their Offers or any Marketage content via the Google Ads platform.</li><br>
               <li class="text-muted text_____align">The Seller's rating is calculated based on the order reviews posted by Buyers or Business Account Team Members. High ratings allow Sellers to obtain advanced Seller levels (see Levels below). In certain cases, exceedingly low ratings may lead to the suspension of the Seller’s account.</li><br>
               <li class="text-muted text_____align">For security concerns, marketage may temporarily disable a Seller’s ability to withdraw revenue to prevent fraudulent or illicit activity. This may come as a result of security issues, improper behavior reported by other users, or associating multiple Marketage accounts to a single withdrawal provider.</li><br>
               <li class="text-muted text_____align">Sellers are responsible for obtaining a general liability insurance policy with coverage amounts that are sufficient to cover all risks associated with the performance of their services.</li>
               <br>

               

               

               <span class="fw-bold">Levels</span>
               <p class="text-muted">Marketage is all about helping Sellers leverage their skills. We seek to empower top performing Sellers with helpful tools to grow their business. Sellers who invest in self-promotion may achieve greater customer satisfaction. And, if they deliver on time and maintain high quality and ratings, Marketage may reward them with new statuses, special opportunities, benefits, and tools that come with it.
              </p>
              <li class="text-muted text_____align">Marketage Sellers can gain account Levels based on their activity, performance and reputation. The advancement criteria can be found here.</li><br>

              <li class="text-muted text_____align">The current Levels a Seller can achieve are, Level 1, 2, and Top Rated.
                Sellers who cannot maintain their high quality service, experience a severe drop in ratings, or stop delivering on time risk losing their Seller status and the benefits that come with it. For example, late deliveries, warnings to the Seller’s account and cancellations can cause a Seller to move to a different Level.
                </li><br>
              <li class="text-muted text_____align">Advanced levels provide their owners with additional benefits, including offering Offers for higher prices through Offer Extras, or selling their Offer in multiples.</li><br>

               <li class="text-muted text_____align">Sellers can also send Custom Offers addressing specific requirements of a Buyer.</li><br>
               <li class="text-muted text_____align">Custom Offers are defined by the Seller with the exact description of the service, the price and the time expected to deliver the service.</li><br>
               <li class="text-muted text_____align">Custom Offers are sent from the conversation page.</li><br>

               <li class="text-muted text_____align">Project Milestones:</li><br>

               <span class="fw-bold">Ownership</span>
               <p class="text-muted">
                Ownership and limitations: When purchasing a Offer on Marketage, unless clearly stated otherwise on the Seller's Offer page/description, when the work is delivered, and subject to payment, the Buyer is granted all intellectual property rights, including but not limited to, copyright in the work delivered from the Seller, and the Seller waives any and all moral rights therein. Accordingly, the Seller expressly assigns to the Buyer the copyright in the delivered work. All transfer and assignment of intellectual property to the Buyer shall be subject to full payment for the offer, and the delivery may not be used if payment is cancelled for any reason. For removal of doubt, in custom created work (such as art work, design work, report generation etc.), the delivered work and its copyright shall be the exclusive property of the Buyer and, upon delivery, the Seller agrees that it thereby, pursuant to these Terms of Service, assigns all right, title and interest in and to the delivered work to the Buyer. Some Offers (including for custom created work) charge additional payments (through Offer Extras) for a Commercial Use License. This means that if you purchase the Offer for personal use, you will own all rights you require for such use, and will not need the Commercial Use License. If you intend to use it for any charge or other consideration, or for any purpose that is directly or indirectly in connection with any business, or other undertaking intended for profit, you will need to buy the Commercial Use License through a OfferExtra and will have broader rights that cover your business use.
                For Voice Over offers, when the work is delivered, and subject to payment, the Buyer is purchasing basic rights, (which means the Buyer is paying a one time fee allowing them to use the work forever and for any purpose except for commercials, radio, television and internet commercial spots). If you intend to use the Voice Over to promote a product and/or service (with the exception of paid marketing channels), you will need to purchase the Commercial Rights (Buy-Out) through Offer Extra. If you intend to use the Voice Over in radio, television and internet commercials, you will need to purchase the Full Broadcast Rights (Buy-Out) through Offer Extra. For further information on the type of buy-outs, please read below.
                Furthermore, users (both Buyers and Sellers) agree that unless they explicitly indicate otherwise, the content users voluntarily create/upload to Marketage, including offer texts, photos, videos, usernames, user photos, user videos and any other information, including the display of delivered work, may be used by Marketage for no consideration for marketing and/or other purposes.
